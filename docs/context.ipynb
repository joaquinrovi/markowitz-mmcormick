    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern Portofolio Theory (MPT), mean variance analysis optimization or Markowitz portfolio optimization is a discrete optimization problem used in finance to allocate a finite budget across several different assets with the aim to maximize returns (expectation) while minimizing risk (variance) of the portfolio. The framework aims to help investors make rational decisions about asset allocation and risk management in order to achieve financial goals through diversification. The theory was constructed by Harry Markowitz in the 1950's and it is based on several assumptions and limitations to be considered like normally distributed returns and constant correlations, which may not always hold true in real-world financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markowitz portofolio optimization problem is a quadratic constrainted optimization problem which in many cases it is hard to solve using conventional open source solvers and requires the use of costly commercial solvers. In this playground project, my aim is to develop an adaptation of the theoretical markowitz quadratic constrainted optimization problem and transform it into a linear constrainted optimization problem using McCormick Envelopes (convex relaxation).\n",
    "\n",
    "McCormick Envelopes are a type of convex relaxation used in bilinear Non Linear Programming problems. Many times these envelopes are used to solve a Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming problem by relaxing the MINLP problem so that it becomes a convex NLP. Relaxing the bounds\n",
    "through a convex relaxation decreases the computational difficulty of solving the problem at the cost of introducing solutions that do not correspond to the original objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quadratic constrained problem (original)\n",
    "\n",
    "The original modern portfolio theory optimization problem is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets and indices\n",
    "* $I$: Set of assets, $i \\in {1,2...,I}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "* $\\mathbb{E}[R_{i}]$: Is the expected return of asset $i$, $\\forall i \\in I$\n",
    "* $\\sigma_{i,j}$: Is the covariance of the periodic returns between asset ${i}$ and asset ${j}$, $\\forall (i,j) \\in I$\n",
    "* $\\mu_{0}$: Is the desired level of the portofolio return.\n",
    "* $\\sigma^{2}$: Is the accepted level of risk in the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision variables\n",
    "* $w_{i}$: Is the capital weight for asset ${i}$, $\\forall i \\in I$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Maximize expected return of the portfolio.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Z_{1} \\space = \\sum_{i \\in I} \\mathbb{E}[R_{i}]w_{i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Minimize the portfolio risk.**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Z_{2} \\space = \\sum_{i \\in I}\\sum_{J \\in I} w_{i}w_{j}\\sigma_{i,j} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    " $$ \\sum_{i \\in I} w_{i} = 1 $$\n",
    " $$ \\sum_{i \\in I}\\sum_{J \\in I} w_{i}w_{j}\\sigma_{i,j} \\leq \\sigma^{2} $$\n",
    " $$ \\sum_{i \\in I} \\mathbb{E}[R_{i}] w_{i} \\geq \\mu_{0}$$\n",
    " $$ 0 \\leq w_{i} \\leq 1, \\forall i \\in I$$\n",
    "\n",
    " The original MPT has the following assumptions to be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Investor Rationality**: MPT assumes that investors are rational and make decisions based on expected returns and risk. It assumes that investors aim to maximize their utility, which is typically represented by their expected return and the standard deviation (volatility) of returns.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Risk and return**: MPT assumes that investors consider the trade-off between risk and return. Investors are assumed to prefer portfolios that offer higher expected returns for a given level of risk or lower risk for a given expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Time Horizon**: The optimization problem should take into account the investor's time horizon. Shorter time horizons may lead to more conservative portfolio choices, while longer time horizons may allow for a higher tolerance for risk.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Diversification**: MPT emphasizes diversification as a means of reducing risk. The assumption is that investors will seek to construct portfolios that are diversified across different asset classes or securities to achieve a more efficient risk-return trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Asset Returns**: MPT assumes that asset returns are normally distributed, and it relies on historical data or expected future returns to estimate these distributions. However, this assumption may not always hold in practice, as returns can exhibit non-normal distributions and may be subject to changing market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Risk-Free Rate**: MPT typically includes a risk-free rate of return as an important parameter. This rate represents the return on a risk-free investment (e.g., a government bond) and serves as a benchmark for comparing the performance of risky portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Portfolio constraints**: Real-world portfolios often have constraints, such as limits on the allocation to certain assets or sectors. These constraints can include minimum and maximum asset allocations, sector limits, and trading restrictions, and they must be considered in the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Transaction Costs and Taxes**: MPT often assumes frictionless markets without transaction costs or taxes. In reality, buying and selling assets can incur costs, and capital gains taxes can affect portfolio returns. These factors should be incorporated into the optimization problem if they are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Stationarity**: Assumptions regarding the stationarity of asset returns (i.e., whether the statistical properties of returns remain constant over time) can impact MPT. In practice, asset returns may exhibit time-varying characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Market Efficiency**: MPT assumes that markets are efficient, meaning that asset prices reflect all available information. If markets are not perfectly efficient, there may be opportunities for active management strategies.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **Risk Assessment**: Accurate assessment of risk through measures such as standard deviation or variance is essential. However, these measures may not capture all aspects of risk, including tail risk or extreme events, which can be crucial for portfolio optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convex relaxed linear constrainted problem (adaptation)\n",
    "\n",
    "The adaptation to the original MPT model can be shown below introducing a new auxiliary decision variable with bounds (upper and lower):\n",

    "\n",
    "In this new formulation, there were two new parameters added, the lower bound $w_{i}^{L}$ and upper bound $w_{i}^{U}$ for the decision variable $w_{i}$ plus an additional auxiliary variable $u_{i,j}$ defined as $u_{i,j}$ = $w_{i}w_{j}$. Solving this new convex LP will yield to a lower bound solution to the original problem.\n"
